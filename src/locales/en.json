    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How far in advance should I book your services?",
        "answer": "We recommend booking our services at least 3-6 months in advance for large events like weddings and corporate functions. For smaller events, 1-2 months notice is usually sufficient. However, we can accommodate last-minute requests depending on availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of events do you plan?",
        "answer": "We specialize in weddings, corporate events, birthday parties, concerts, exhibitions, trade shows, sports events, and private celebrations. Our team has experience with events ranging from intimate gatherings of 20 people to large-scale events with 1000+ attendees."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you provide full-service event planning or partial planning?",
        "answer": "We offer both full-service and partial planning options. Full-service includes complete event management from concept to execution. Partial planning allows you to handle some aspects while we manage specific areas like vendor coordination, timeline management, or day-of coordination."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is included in your event planning packages?",
        "answer": "Our packages typically include venue selection, vendor coordination, timeline creation, budget management, design consultation, day-of coordination, and post-event follow-up. Specific inclusions vary based on the package selected and event requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle event budgets?",
        "answer": "We work within your specified budget and provide detailed cost breakdowns for all services. We have established relationships with vendors that often allow us to secure better rates. We also provide budget tracking throughout the planning process and can suggest cost-saving alternatives when appropriate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule my event?",
        "answer": "We understand that circumstances can change. Our cancellation policy varies by package and timing. We work with you to minimize costs and can often help reschedule rather than cancel. Specific terms are outlined in our service agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with specific vendors or can I choose my own?",
        "answer": "We have a network of trusted vendors we work with regularly, but we're happy to work with your preferred vendors as well. We can also help you find new vendors that match your style and budget requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure my event runs smoothly on the day?",
        "answer": "We have a detailed timeline and contingency plans in place. Our team arrives early to oversee setup, coordinates with all vendors, manages the timeline, and handles any issues that arise. We also provide you with a dedicated point of contact throughout the event."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you help with destination events or events outside your local area?",
        "answer": "Yes, we can assist with destination events. While we're based locally, we have experience coordinating events in various locations and can work with local vendors or travel to the event location as needed. Additional travel costs may apply."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes your event planning services different?",
        "answer": "We combine years of experience with personalized attention to detail. Our team is passionate about creating unique, memorable experiences tailored to your vision. We also offer comprehensive support throughout the entire process and maintain strong relationships with quality vendors."
